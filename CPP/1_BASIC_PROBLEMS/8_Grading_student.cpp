// Problem Statement:

// A studentâ€™s grade is rounded according to the following rules:

// If the grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs.
// If the grade is 38 or greater, it is rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 if the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3.
// Write a function that takes a list of grades and returns a list with the rounded grades according to the rules above.

// Input:

// A list of integers grades, where each integer represents a student's grade.
// Output:

// A list of integers where each grade is rounded according to the specified rules.
// Example:

// Input:
// grades = [73, 67, 38, 33]

// Output:
// [75, 67, 40, 33]

// Explanation:

// 73 is rounded to 75.
// 67 remains the same.
// 38 is rounded to 40.
// 33 remains the same since it is less than 38.
