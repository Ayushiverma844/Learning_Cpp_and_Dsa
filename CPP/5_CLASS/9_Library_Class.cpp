üîñ Problem Statement: Library Management System - Book Lending Tracker
You are tasked with developing a basic Library Management System that allows a librarian to manage book operations. Implement a program that can:

Add a new book to the library with its title and author.

Lend a book to a user if it is available.

Return a book to the library and mark it as available.

Dynamically manage memory to store new books when the storage limit is reached.

üßæ Functional Requirements:
Implement a class Library with the following functionalities:

Attributes:

bookTitle (string)

author (string)

isAvailable (boolean)

Functions:

addBook(): Accepts book title and author name as input and sets availability to true.

lendBook(): Issues the book if available, else displays a message.

returnBook(): Returns the book and updates its availability status.

Appropriate getter and setter methods for all data members.

You must also handle dynamic memory reallocation for storing more books when the initial storage limit (10 books) is exceeded.

üí° Input Format:
On each iteration, user will choose one of the options:

markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Add Book Details
2. Lend Book
3. Return Book
4. Exit
For option 1, input:

Book Title (string)

Author Name (string)

For option 2 and 3:

Book Title (string)

üñ•Ô∏è Output Format:
Display appropriate messages for each action:

When a book is added.

When a book is lent or unavailable.

When a book is returned or if it's not found.

‚úÖ Constraints:
Initial capacity of the library is 10 books. Increase by 10 when exceeded.

Titles are case-sensitive and unique.

Input strings can include spaces.

üìå Sample Interaction:

1.) Add Book Details
2.) Lend Book
3.) Return Book
4.) Exit
